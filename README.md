# discordcss
Some css themes i've made for discord for use with beautifuldiscord. some of them more complicated than others, some are unfinished, etc!

Because I like switching things up and nobody likes heading into the command line every time, i've made a python script that lets you swap them with one input!

## Setup

1. Install python3 (python2 is unsupported.)

2. Run `install_requirements.bat`. this is currently only
the beautifuldiscord module, which you can read more about [here, at its github repository](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord).

## How to use

1. run `launch.py`, and follow instructions! Make sure to wait for it to
finish what it's doing, it will let you know if something goes wrong.

## Themes

Maybe i'll come back some day and actually fully describe these themes i've made, but here are some short blurbs

### Syndicate

A dark red syndicate uplink themed css from SS13.

todo: i've been considering making pngs of syndicate operatives with staticy gif avatars for everyone to use in the same src checking fashion as
information superhighway

### ToonTown

Not even finished enough to say there's a color theme here

ToonTown themed with the toontown skybox as the background for the main scroller. I never finished this, so it's quite bad.

todo: honestly, get rid of this garbage (but it is hilarious to drop a screenshot of it in chat)

### Information Superhighway

A dark blue-ish theme that uses the poster for Tomorrow Corporation's upcoming game, Information Superhighway

It checks the avatar src of each avatar and applies a gooball. cool, right?

todo: fix the color scheme
