# discordcss
css themes i've made for discord for use with beautifuldiscord. some of them more complicated than others, some are unfinished, etc!

## Syndicate

Syndicate uplink themed css from SS13.

## ToonTown

ToonTown themed with the toontown skybox as the background for the main scroller. I never finished this, so it's quite bad.

## InformationSuperhighway

Advanced css theme that uses scss to create the output file to make an omage to Tomorrow Corporation.

It checks the avatar src of each avatar and applies a gooball. cool, right?
